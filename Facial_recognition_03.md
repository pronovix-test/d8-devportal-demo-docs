### Skin texture analysis

An emerging trend uses the visual details of the skin, as captured in standard digital or scanned images.
This technique, called skin texture analysis, turns the unique lines, patterns, and spots apparent in a personâ€™s skin into a mathematical space.

Tests have shown that with the addition of skin texture analysis, performance in recognizing faces can increase 20 to 25 percent.

### Thermal cameras

A different form of taking input data for face recognition is by using thermal cameras, by this procedure the cameras will only detect the shape of the head and it will ignore the subject accessories such as glasses, hats, or make up.
A problem with using thermal pictures for face recognition is that the databases for face recognition is limited.
Diego Socolinsky, and Andrea Selinger (2004) research the use of thermal face recognition in real life, and operation sceneries, and at the same time build a new database of thermal face images.
The research uses low-sensitive, low-resolution ferro-electric electrics sensors that are capable of acquire long wave thermal infrared (LWIR).
The results show that a fusion of LWIR and regular visual cameras has the greater results in outdoor probes.
Indoor results show that visual has a 97.05% accuracy, while LWIR has 93.93%, and the Fusion has 98.40%, however on the outdoor proves visual has 67.06%, LWIR 83.03%, and fusion has 89.02%.
The study used 240 subjects over the period of 10 weeks to create the new database. The data was collected on sunny, rainy, and cloudy days.
